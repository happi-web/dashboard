# Dashboard Design

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. The goal is to create a fully functional and visually appealing dashboard layout using CSS Grid as the primary tool for layout design.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to practice and reinforce skills in creating complex layouts using CSS Grid. The dashboard includes a sidebar, navigation, and content sections, styled with modern UI principles.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: A fixed sidebar containing logo, navigation links, and other useful controls.
- **Main Content Area**: A grid-based layout for displaying key information and interactive elements.
- **Theming**: A consistent color scheme using CSS variables for easy customization.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the dashboard content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout, with an emphasis on CSS Grid for layout design.
- **JavaScript (Optional)**: For adding interactivity (e.g., dynamic content updates or animations).

## Screenshots

Include screenshots or a GIF of the dashboard to showcase the layout and functionality.
